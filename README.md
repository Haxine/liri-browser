# Liri Browser

__Liri Browser development has moved to [LiriOS/browser](https://github.com/lirios/browser).__

Effort has begun there to create the next generation of the browser.
A rewrite from scratch was necessary because we wanted to adopt new technologies like
QtQuick Controls 2. We're also aiming to archieve a better code structure and better cross-platform support.

This repository remains as __read-only archive__. Please __don't open any new issues or pull-requests__.
